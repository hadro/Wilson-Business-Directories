From the superior mode of its manufacture, it possesses remarkable

“STRENGTH AND DURABILITY,

beyond any Bandit’tg manufactured. It also excels in its running quali-
. ties any band made upon other principles andof other materials.

The belt made ofleather is the only one that can be relied upon to per-
form well in all situations. It neither melts with friction, sucks to the
pullies, nor frets into shreds ; nor is it subject to sudden combustion and
((l‘estructiom—all which are marked characteristics of Beltings made from
wums. ‘ '

The Patent Machine-stretched Leather Banding,

As made by the Subscriber, will stand more» heat, more cold, more fric-
tion, and it is far more durable than those above reterred to, and for all
practical purposes; it can also be made waterproof.

The best evidence of its quality is its adoption by nearly all the exten-
sive manufacturers and machinists throughout the city and country, the
River and Sound Steamers, and (with marked approbation) by the vari-
ous lines of Ocean Steamers. " Since its introduction by the Subscriber it
has revolutionized machinery to the general exclusion of gearing; and
the approval of practical mechanics is further emphatically expressed
by the steady increase in the demand for it from year to year. Every
Belt is warranted to possess all the qualities requisite for durability and
good performanCe, or the money returned. '

They can be furnished of any length and Width, from 1 to 24 inches,
. either single, double, or round.“ Also, superior Lace Leather, with rivets,
burrs, punches, sets, &c. ' WM. KUMBEL.
