“f“ THE CITY DIREC‘TORY.—-We received from, the publishers, Messrs.
- LiTrow 62;, Wilson, on the ﬁrst of the month, a copy of their new City Di-
rectory for 1862 and ’53. We haVe carefully 'looked'it over, and must
' giveaskour opinionnthat it is a decided'improvement on all» previous
. eﬁ‘orts in the way of Directory. The Mirror. WhOse editor'ha's been for-
tunate enough to see a copy of the rival Directory, inferrns us that it is
minus some 25,630 names that appear in the editionrof Messrs Trow &*
- -erson—ahat is, Wilson & Trow’s Directory contains 122,190 names,
While. the othercontains only 96,560. This fact is the {most conciusive
* iprotrf of the relative value of the two Directories. In addition to the-Di- .
' rectory ofnames,-this work contains a mass ‘of useful information, meet.
