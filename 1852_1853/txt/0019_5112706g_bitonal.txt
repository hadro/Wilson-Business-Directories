.5 These are the only Safes manu-
: factured which combine. the two Pa-
tents. Rich’s Patent was granted in
September, 1842 ; VVilder’s Patent

of these Safes, they are rendered free

from dampness, and are warranted

FIRE PROOF.
From the numerous certiﬁcates tO'
be seen at the subscribers’ store, we
~ - . ~ ., have only room for‘ thefollowing; but
they are sufﬁcient to show the capability of these Safes to resist any
amount theat, under any circumstances. The great ﬁre Of. New .
York in 1845, and the Camp-street ﬁre, New Orleans, 1850, were
two of the hotest ﬁres ever witnessed in this country, and in each
ﬁre Rich’s Safes came out triumphant. In no one instance has there
ever been a single book or paper, or a Single dollar lost by ﬁre, or
thieves, in one of Rich d‘ Co’s Safes. ' ' ‘ '

THE GREAT FIRE IN CI-IILICOTHE, OHIO..—-—O,NE THIRD OF THE
TOVVNVBURNT TO ASHES! .
“ Chilicothe, Ohio, 13th April, 1852.
Messrs. Stearnsg‘Marv-in : Gentleme11,——Yours of the 5th is at
hand. In reply, every Safe in the ﬁre, EXCEPT YOURS, has proved
good for nothing. I lost a large Safe—it was perfectly destroyed-~-
but in the small Salamander I bought of you, nothing was injured.
Your. obedient servant, , WM. T. CLEMSON.”

These repeated occurrences prove incontestably that Wilder’s Pa- ,
tent Salamanders, with RICH’S IMPROVEMENT, are the best Safes
made in the United States, or in the whole world. They can be had
at the Depot, 146 ’Water-street, and at the Factory, corner of St.
IWIark’s Place and Avenue A, N eW-York.
